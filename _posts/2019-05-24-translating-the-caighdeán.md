As I have been learning Irish, I have wanted a grammar reference in English. There is a very nice Irish grammar reference by Lars Braesicke on the web at [http://braesicke.de/gramadac.htm](http://braesicke.de/gramadac.htm), unfortunately, it is in German, which I read, but not as well as I read English. (There is an English translation of Lars’ site, but it is not up to date, and he does not have access to update it.)

I have used the Caighdeán Oifigiúil, the official Irish language reference produced by the Irish government, but that is in Irish, and so any time I have to look something up, it means there will be the effort to translate it (which often requires several dictionaries) as well as the effort to understand what it is saying. The natural next step was to translate it to English as a reference so I didn’t have to translate on the fly when I wanted to use it.

From forum posts on the Duolingo Irish forum: [https://forum.duolingo.com/topic/901](https://forum.duolingo.com/topic/901), it seems that there are others who would also like an up-to-date Irish grammar reference in English, so I decided I would put this on the web (which has the benefit that Irish speakers who happen upon it can let me know if they have improvements).

I spent a good deal of effort (with the help of some other Duolingo moderators) looking into the copyright policy covering the Caighdeán to make sure I wouldn’t run afoul of the Irish government. That is a story in itself, which I may post in more detail in the future. I did determine to the best of my ability that translating it for public use appears to be allowable. I have posted the copyright information with links in [a blog post]({% post_url 2019-05-23-copyright-information %}), and, naturally, if the Irish government gets in touch and tells me to take it down, I will do it without delay.

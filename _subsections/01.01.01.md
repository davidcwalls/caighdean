There is one article in the Irish language - the definite article. The subject of the article is called the definite noun. Here the article has two forms: *an* and *na*. The article is placed before the noun, e.g. *an baile*; *an mhír*; *na caoirigh*; *teach na cúirte*; or before whatever word is put in front of the noun as a qualifier e.g. *an uile dhuine*; *scéal mhadra na n-ocht gcos*; *tús na chéad seachtaine*. <span class="questionable-translation">It is possible to replace the article with possessive adjectives</span> e.g. *Tá an croí ag cur air*; *Bhí an ghrian ag baint na súl asam*.
